      <p>Enso Artspace opens the autumn exhibition schedule with new work by Kelly Packer in “For What Comes After.” In this series Packer investigates the remnants of mining towns of the West. Working from photographs taken during visits to these towns, Packer employs her vibrant color palette to assemble imagery that distills the nature of these quick-to-thrive, quick-to-perish abandoned places. The ominous presence of the mountains, shreds of wallpaper, rust and splintered wood are some of the elements expressed in these works. Also included in this exhibition are richly colored oil stick drawings of noxious plants that overcome these deserted lands.</p>
