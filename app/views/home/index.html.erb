    <p><a href="http://www.artmobilemontana.org/" title="Art Mobile of Montana">Art Mobile</a> is a van of artwork that travels the huge state of Montana. Along the way they stop at schools, state parks, senior citizens centers and other organizations. The teacher unpacks the exhibit and gives a presentation about the work. With a state as big as Montana, it's an innovative way to bring art to some of the more isolated pockets of the state.</p>
    <p>I feel very fortunate they found me and came to my door to pick up a work that will travel the state. I am honored to be amongst such a diverse and active roster of <a href="http://www.artmobilemontana.org/2015-2016-artists.html" title="Art Mobile Montana - Artist Directory">Montana artists.</a></p>

    <p>I had a show at the Clark Chateau in Butte, Montana in July and August of 2015. The work I created for the show felt very true to Butte as a place. I really enjoyed the people I met through the exhibition and having a show is such a historic setting. <a href="http://www.kellypacker.com/artwork/series/to-the-silver-hurt-of-home">Check out the work &raquo;</a></p>
